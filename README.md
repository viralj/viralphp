Project idea -
		I was working on PHP websites and I was looking for help to create Custom URL and better performance
		like a professional website or CMS. I found some tutorials which helped me to create clean url using
		apache and htaccess file. Then I looked for php frameworks and found that its hard for me to work on
		because framework requires to learn how they works. I didn't want to learn that so I created my own
		custom php script that works like frameworks. Easy to write codes, user friendly, clean urls and the
		best feature of this project is that you don't need to get a VPS or Dedicated server.
		
		Yes, you can host this project on shared hosting without paying lots of money.
		


How to use viralphp?
--------------------

		Using viralphp is very easy. All you need is basic knowledge of PHP OOP and how to work with PHP classes
		with MySql, HTML, CSS, Javascript etc. If you know how to use jQuery, ajax and other features, its plus
		point for you. As this is the first release of viralphp, you can use mysql queries with PDO(PHP DATA OBJECT)
		only. In upcoming releases we will emplacement other options and drivers as much as we can which will help
		you to create your website the way you want.
